**We are actively soliciting generous sponsorships and donations**.

The Fair includes unique opportunities for those high-school students to 
interact with JSU current students and faculties in the College of Science, Engineering and Technology. 
We believe that these interactions will inspire and motivate young students to 
consider their studies and career in the STEM disciplines. 
Consequently, students who have demonstrated an interest in mathematical and engineering fields 
will directly benefit from participating in this Fair. 

Over the past years, this Fair has been sponsored by:

* National Science Foundation (NSF) Grant Award DMS: 1330801 under the
EXTREEMS-QED Activities
* College of Science, Engineering and Technology
* Department of Mathematics and Statistical Sciences
* McGraw Hill Education
* Pearson Higher Education
* EnVision Eye Care & Optical Boutique
