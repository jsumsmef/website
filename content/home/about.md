# [2017 Fair Event Flyer](/pdf/2017JSU_MEF_Flyer.pdf)
# Date: Friday, March 31, 2017
# Location: Just Hall of Science 

# Theme:"Your Place on the Grid: Big Data Influences on Your Life."
The Fair comprises individual team events that are designed to facilitate student engagement in
learning experiences in which they can demonstrate their mathematical understanding, apply
mathematics and scientific understanding, and learn about developing areas of mathematics. The
Fair also includes opportunities for students to interact with JSU students and faculty in the
College of Science, Engineering and Technology. We believe that these interactions will inspire
and motivate your students to continue their studies in the STEM disciplines. Consequently,
students who have demonstrated an interest in scientific and mathematical fields will benefit
from participating in this Fair.
